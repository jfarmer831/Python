# Python
Python programming projects.

This repository contains the code for a 2 week Live project I completed as part of a team. The code consist of code from other team members. My code contribution is:
  NewsScraper(): This application scarpes a website for top three featured stories and returns the information with featured picture and article title as a link back to the original page. 
  MessageApp():  This message app allows user to user messaging via inbox functionality.
